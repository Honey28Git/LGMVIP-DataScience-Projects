## Overview
In the Music Recommendation Model challenge on Kaggle, I utilized the KKBox Music Dataset to develop a predictive model aimed at determining the likelihood of song repetition. The objective was to identify the main features responsible for whether a song had been played more than once, ultimately enhancing the music recommendation system.

## Problem
The challenge focused on predicting song repetition based on various features within the dataset. Understanding the factors that influence song plays is crucial for improving user engagement and satisfaction in music streaming services. The key problem was to classify whether each song was played repeatedly or not.

## Approach
Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and the relationships between features. This included visualizing data distributions and identifying patterns.

## Model Development: I implemented a Random Forest model due to its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and its ability to provide feature importance scores. 
I also performed parameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Feature Selection: Identified and selected key features that significantly impacted song repetition. The top three features influencing repetition were:
1. source_system_tab
2. source_screen_name
3. source_type

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics, achieving a successful prediction rate of 65%. 
This indicated that the model could accurately predict which songs were likely to be played repeatedly.

## Findings
The Random Forest model accurately predicted that 891,143 songs were played on repeat while identifying 1,665,647 songs that were not played repeatedly.
The analysis revealed that specific features, such as the source of the play, had a significant influence on the likelihood of song repetition.

## Conclusion
The Music Recommendation Model challenge provided valuable insights into the factors driving song repetition.
By effectively leveraging machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis, I developed a random forest model that could predict song plays with 65% accuracy. 
This work not only contributes to the understanding of user behavior in music consumption but also offers a foundation for further enhancements in music recommendation systems.
